# EtherContracts
This is a Ethereum smart contracts test project. In this project we build some smart contracts to demostrate an automated Ether/Token distribution DApp.

# Development Tools

We use [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuit/truffle) and [TestRPC](https://github.com/ethereumjs/testrpc) as the compile tools. In Ubuntu environment, install the tools using the following commands:

```
npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc truffle
```

# Compile and Test the contract

```
truffle init
```
Write the contract `.sol` file in the `contracts` directory.
